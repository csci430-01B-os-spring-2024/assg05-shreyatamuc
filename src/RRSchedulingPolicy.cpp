 * Implementation file for our RRSchedulingPolicy class.  The
 * RRSchedulingPolicy class is an abstract base class that defines the
 * interface for implementing different job scheduling policies.
 * Basically any scheduling policy needs to be notified when a
 * newProcess() arrives, a process runs a runCpuCycle(), and when a
 * process finished().  The main method of this stategy abstraction is
 * the dispatch() method, which is called by the scheduling simulator
 * whenever the cpu is idle, and the scheduling policy needs to make a
 * decision.

 * system instance we are associated with, so we can call the paging system to
 * get needed information to make replacment decisions.
